Retrieved stock data from Yahoo-Finance for Apple, Google and Microsoft and then preprocessed data into Training and Validation sets. Performed Moving Average, Linear Regression and KNN based prediction and classification with avg. RMSE 66, 38, 68 respectively.
Using sequential wavelet transforms for LSTM Stacked Auto-Encoders based prediction with around 70% accuracy. Plotted graphs for all methods, also compared and analyzed visible as well as numeric difference in the accuracy of predictions for each.
The over-all results showed that LSTM Stacked Auto-Encoders show promising results whereas others showed abnormal predictions.
